# Code Style and Structure

## Code Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

## Syntax and Formatting
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- No duplicate code; check if some logic is already written before writing it# Code Style and Structure
